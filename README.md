# Navpulse CMS

Navpulse CMS is a content management system designed for business owners to manage their storefront promotions, view analytics, and update their profile information for the Downtown Navpulse app. It also serves as the official landing page for the Navpulse app, providing more information about its features and benefits.

## About Navpulse

Navpulse is an innovative mobile app designed to increase foot traffic and boost sales potential for downtown businesses. Participating storefronts are equipped with BLE beacons, allowing app users to "pulse" a storefront and collect coins. These coins can be redeemed in the rewards shop for deals, discounts, raffle entries, and more.

### Key Benefits:
- Encourages foot traffic by rewarding users for visiting storefronts.
- Provides businesses with a direct way to promote deals and specials.
- Eliminates the need for users to follow multiple social media pages to stay updated on promotions.
- Creates a fun and engaging way for users to explore their city.
- Provide analytics of storefront visits and pulses to businesses, as well as coupon redemptions, and     other foot traffic analytics
